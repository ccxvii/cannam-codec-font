This is Codec, a programmers' font in a single bitmap size.

Three variants are included: proportional, monospaced, and monospaced
condensed. The glyphs are identical, only the spacing differs.

The bdf/ directory contains the original X11 fonts as designed. These
are compiled into psf, sfd, and OpenType (bitmaps only) by the make
process.

Codec was designed in 1998 and has undergone some changes since then.
In particular, the font as originally designed had the full-stop
(period, ".") centred vertically, instead of on the baseline; this
quickly irritated, and the usual positioning has now been restored.
Additionally the caret ("^") was originally designed as an upward
arrow with a stem which has now been removed.

Many thanks to Tor Andersson for providing the bdf2sfd program that
finally makes it possible to provide an OpenType version. The
conversion also relies on FontForge by George Williams. Codec was
originally drawn using xmbdfed by Mark Leisher.

These fonts are copyright 1998-2010 Chris Cannam. You may copy, edit
and redistribute Codec, provided that this README file is made
available with each distribution, that the original copyright is
